My ottobock [1], inspired a single EMG but multi grip pattern myoelectric prosthetic hand.

It uses an algorithm called DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) [2], which normally is a speech recognition algorithm, picking 'yes'/'no' like words out of sentences in simple terms.

I presented a short part of this project in IJANSER presentation [3] before.

Below are some of the images from the project and a working video demonstration I recorded.
